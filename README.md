# Dynamic Feature-based Newsvendor

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to our innovative research presented in the "Dynamic Feature-based Newsvendor" paper, where we merge feature information with multi-period inventory control. Dive into the realm of inventory management with our Contextual Value Iteration (CVI) algorithm, which not only converges faster but also has provable sample complexity advantages over traditional MDP approaches.

## Repository Contents
- `Dynamic_Feature-based_Newsvendor.pdf`: The paper detailing our research and findings.
- `CMDP_test_update.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for both the baseline models and our proposed CVI algorithm.

## Future Directions
Our next steps include extending the model to non-Markovian features and investigating actions with both immediate and delayed effects.

## How to Use
To replicate our study or experiment with the CVI algorithm, run the code provided in the Jupyter notebook.

## Contributions
We encourage the community to contribute to this repository by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or extending the algorithm.
